description: "This chapter explores two features of the Star English Book, where users can randomly retrieve words for review and set the level of word mastery to better clarify their review targets. These two functions allow users to have a clearer plan for word learning. At the same time, we delve into RESTful related technologies to enhance the richness and practicality of the interfaces."

In this chapter, we will further enrich the Star English Book by providing users with two practical functions:
- Randomly retrieve several words to facilitate user review;
- Set word mastery levels to clarify review targets.

During this process, we will study `RESTful` in depth to provide more enriched interfaces.
