## Book Introduction
---
The knowledge in the `Web` development field is vast, with various libraries, standards, and frameworks intertwining like the roots of a century-old tree. Beginners may feel like they're facing a hedgehog, unsure where to start.

This book will start with the `GoFrame` framework, guiding beginners to actually develop a project: **Star English Book**. The aim is to provide readers with a comprehensible `GoFrame` framework learning guide to help them quickly master it.

Oriented towards practical projects, the book shares more professional and practical programming skills and experiences, with the expectation that readers will achieve success!

## Target Audience
---
This book is suitable for those who have a basic understanding of `Golang` and wish to learn the `GoFrame` framework.

The book does not cover any front-end development, so even if you are completely unfamiliar with any front-end technologies, you can read it without obstacles.

### Students
If you are a student interested in the `Go` language and want to learn how to use it to develop an interesting project or a graduation design, laying a foundation for your career, this book can serve as an entry point into programming, guiding you on how to become a real programmer.

### Beginner Programmers
If you are already a programmer but not very familiar with `Go` and want to further master the language or learn the `GoFrame` framework, this book can help you quickly get started with the `GoFrame` framework, allowing you to quickly integrate into the world of the `Go` language and expand your tech stack.

## Reading Suggestions
---
This is a hands-on book, and the only suggestion is to follow it step by step. Learning from books alone can be superficial; practical experience is essential!

While following the book, it's best to refer to the [official development manual](https://goframe.org/docs/design) and try to extrapolate on it to better understand and master the content.
