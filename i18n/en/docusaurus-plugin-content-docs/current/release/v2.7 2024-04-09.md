Hello everyone, the `GoFrame` framework has officially released version `v2.7.0` today! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

The highlight of this version is the provision of the `metric` monitoring component. The main library offers an interface-based `metric` design, and the community component provides an `OpenTelemetry`-based `metric` interface implementation. This feature is disabled by default and only enabled by default when specific interface implementations or community implementations are introduced. The current version also provides implementations for monitoring metrics of `HTTP Client&Server`, and metrics for other components will be provided in subsequent versions. For details, please refer to the documentation: [Service Monitoring and Alerts](../docs/服务可观测性/服务监控告警/服务监控告警.md).

Additionally, this version implements support for the `Save` operation for `dm/mssql/oracle/pgsql/sqlite` databases, thanks to community member [https://github.com/oldme-git](https://github.com/oldme-git) 💖.

Moreover, it is worth mentioning that in this version, we have added an ignore symbol `#` for the second-level field of the `gcron` scheduled task component, used to convert the `6`-segment cron pattern into a `5`-segment Linux crontab pattern, addressing the issue of task execution inaccuracy due to delay at the second-level granularity: [Scheduled Task - Expression](../docs/组件列表/系统相关/定时任务-gcron/定时任务-表达式.md).

Due to the numerous changes in this version, below is an introduction to some important improvements in Chinese. For the detailed `ChangeLog`, please refer to: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases/tag/v2.7.0](https://github.com/gogf/gf/releases/tag/v2.7.0).

## Component Improvements

1. `gdb`
    1. Added `Stats` interface definition and implementation for obtaining connection pool information maintained by the current database `orm` object: [ORM Advanced Features - Connection Pool Status](../docs/核心组件/数据库ORM/ORM高级特性/ORM高级特性-连接池状态.md)
    2. Added `FormatUpsert` interface definition and implementation, used for writing/updating operations for different database types, i.e., `Save` operation.
    3. Added `SqlType` type, changing the existing `sql type` type definition from `string` to `SqlType` type.
    4. Added `Model.OnConflict` method for implementing update policy when field unique key conflicts for some database types, particularly for `Save` operation.
    5. Fixed the issue where the `ClearTableFieldsAll` method was not effective.
2. `ghttp`
    1. Added `MiddlewareNeverDoneCtx` middleware, which developers can choose to use to avoid issues related to `context cancel` on the server side when clients cancel requests: [Common Issues](../docs/WEB服务开发/常见问题.md)
    2. Added monitoring metric implementation for `http server`, which is disabled by default and does not affect performance, unless the `metrics` feature is enabled: [HTTPServer - Monitoring Metrics](../docs/WEB服务开发/高级特性/HTTPServer-监控指标.md)
    3. Improved `tracing` records, changing the `span` name from `query uri` to `route uri` for easier aggregation when viewing.
    4. Changed the type of `EnterTime` and `LeaveTime` properties in the `Request` object from `int64` to `*gtime.Time`.
    5. Marked the `WebSocket` method as deprecated, it will be removed in future major versions, along with the removal of `http server's` built-in coupling support for `websocket`. It is recommended to use other open-source `websocket` components with `http server` for more decoupled flexibility in the future.
    6. Fixed a memory issue caused by large file uploads due to the `Request Body` being readable multiple times by default.
    7. Fixed the issue where the `pattern` parameter of the `StartPProfServer` method was ineffective.
    8. Added the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers Header` return to the `Request.ServeFileDownload` method to support `ajax` file requests.
    9. Added `SwaggerUITemplate` configuration option to the service configuration for quickly configuring the `HTML` content of the `SwaggerUI` page.
    10. The `http server` no longer prints built-in middleware when starting route printing.
3. `gclient`
    1. Fixed the issue that forced all `http` requests to go through service discovery domain name resolution when service discovery is enabled.
    2. Added monitoring metric implementation for `http client`, which is disabled by default and does not affect performance, unless the `metrics` feature is enabled: [HTTPClient - Monitoring Metrics](../docs/WEB服务开发/HTTPClient/HTTPClient-监控指标.md)
4. `gcron`
    1. Added an ignore symbol `#`, using it as a placeholder for the **second-level field** in the `cron pattern`, indicating the ignore of the second-level field, converting a `6`-segment `cron pattern` to a `5`-segment `linux crontab pattern`: [Scheduled Task - Expression](../docs/组件列表/系统相关/定时任务-gcron/定时任务-表达式.md)
    2. Fixed an issue where specified second-level tasks (for example `2 * * * * *`) might execute twice if there is inaccurate time at the underlying level.
5. `gerror`
    1. Fixed an issue with the recursive logic being ineffective in the `gerror.HasCode` method.
6. `g`
    1. Improved the `DumpJson` method for printing any variables in `JSON` format.
7. `gcache`
    1. Fixed an issue caused by excessive `goroutine` due to the creation of a large number of `Cache` objects.
8. `gcmd`
    1. Added `RunWithSpecificArgs` method, used to run command objects with custom `arguments`.
    2. Fixed the issue of parameter loss due to conflicts between parameter struct names and struct tag names in some scenarios.
9. `gfsnotify`
    1. Fixed a `panic` issue that might occur when the `gfsnotify` object is closed.
10. `glog`
    1. Fixed the redundant `rotate` issue of `.gz` suffix log compressed files related to the `rotate` feature.
11. `gmetric`
    1. Added `gmetric` component using a decoupled design, only providing the interface definition and `Noop` implementation, with the real implementation in community components. The `metric` feature will only be enabled when specific implementations are introduced: [Service Monitoring and Alerts](../docs/服务可观测性/服务监控告警/服务监控告警.md)
12. `gproc`
    1. Fixed an issue where process parameter parsing might fail under `windows`.
    2. Improved `Signal` signal listening implementation, allowing adding signal handling methods at runtime.
13. `gview`
    1. Fixed a robustness issue caused by the `os.Getwd` method execution failure.
14. `gconv`
    1. `json.RawMessage` supports receiving parameter conversions for the `slice` type.
    2. Fixed a recursive conversion failure issue caused by missing the `Deep` parameter in the `MapDeep` internal conversion.
    3. Improved the internal `Map` traversal logic using `MapRange`, enhancing execution performance.

   1. Added `SentinelUsername` and `SentinelPassword` parameter configurations to expand support for the `Redis Sentinel` mode: [Redis Configuration Management](../docs/组件列表/NoSQL%20Redis/Redis-配置管理.md)
   2. Improved the `Redis` interface implementation, allowing developers to flexibly customize and extend the implementation of the community component object `redis.Redis` type: [Redis Interface Design](../docs/组件列表/NoSQL%20Redis/Redis-接口化设计.md)
4. Improved the `contrib/registry/etcd` component, allowing developers to configure verification information for `etcd` connections.
5. Improvements to the `contrib/rpc/grpcx` component:
   1. Safely truncate request content when the `tracing` feature is enabled.
   2. Added support for the `logger` configuration option, allowing configuration of the `grpc server` log object through the `logger` configuration option in the configuration file: [Server Configuration](../docs/微服务开发/服务端配置.md)
6. Improvements to the `contrib/trace/otlphttp` and `contrib/trace/otlpgrpc` components, fixing data loss issues of `trace` that may occur even with normal `ShutDown` in short process scenarios.

## Development Tools
