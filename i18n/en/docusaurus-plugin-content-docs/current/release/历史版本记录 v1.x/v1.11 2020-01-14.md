description: "GoFrame is a modular, high-performance, production-grade Go development framework that offers a rich set of core components such as caching, logging, file handling, timing, and command-line interfaces. It supports web service development with features like hot restart and multi-domain support, and is widely used in microservices, IoT, blockchain, e-commerce, and banking projects."

`GF(Go Frame)` [https://goframe.org](https://wiki.goframe.org) is a modular, high-performance, production-grade Go development framework. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure including commonly used core development components such as caching, logging, files, timing, queues, arrays, collections, strings, timers, command-line, file locks, memory locks, object pools, connection pools, resource management, data validation, data encoding, file monitoring, scheduled tasks, database ORM, TCP/UDP components, process management/communication, concurrency-safe containers, etc. It offers core components for web service development, such as Router, Cookie, Session, Middleware, service registration, configuration management, template engine, and supports features like hot restart, hot update, multi-domain, multi-port, multi-service, HTTPS, Rewrite, and more.

`GoFrame` has a rich set of foundational modules, a complete toolchain, and detailed documentation. In the nearly two years since its open-source release, `GoFrame` has gained increasing recognition and support, evolving from obscurity to widespread application in enterprise-grade production projects such as microservices, IoT, blockchain, e-commerce systems, and banking. It has been tested in projects with hundreds of thousands to millions of users and was awarded the `GVP` Most Valuable Open-Source Project by Gitee in 2019. `GoFrame` is rapidly growing, with release iterations every 1-2 months, and an active community welcomes you to join the `GoFrame` family.

Finally, I wish everyone a Happy New Year 2020, the Year of the Rat!
