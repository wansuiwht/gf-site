## Feature Improvements

The minimum required Golang version for the framework has been upgraded from `v1.15` to `v1.18`.

1. `g`
    1. Added the `g.Go` method to conveniently create asynchronous `goroutines` with `ctx` and `recover` parameters.
2. `glog`
    1. Improved the `Handler` callback processing function's `HandlerInput` input parameters by adding `Values` parameter, which is the input parameter list for log printing: [Log Component-Handler](../docs/核心组件/日志组件/日志组件-Handler.md)
    2. Added a general method `HandlerStructure` to print log content with structured parameters: [Log Component-Handler](../docs/核心组件/日志组件/日志组件-Handler.md)
    3. Improved the log file `rotate` logic to solve the problem of failing to `rotate` files in certain scenarios.
3. `gerror`
    1. Added error stack mode (`brief/detail`): In `brief` mode, the error stack will only print non-framework component stacks. In `detail` mode, the error stack will print the complete framework code call chain. The framework uses `brief` mode by default: [Error Handling-Other Features](../docs/核心组件/错误处理/错误处理-其他特性.md)
4. `gcode`
    1. Added `gcode.CodeInternalPanic` error code, and all `panic` errors captured by framework components will return with this error code.
5. `gmap`
    1. Added `Diff` method for comparing and returning the differences between two `Map` objects.
6. `gaes`
    1. Added `PKCS7Padding/PKCS7UnPadding` methods.
7. `gdb`
    1. Removed `ConvertDataForRecord` conversion method, added `ConvertValueForField` conversion method.
    2. Modified the `CheckLocalTypeForField` method, changing the return parameter type from `string` to `LocalType`.
    3. These are mainly used for database implementations and usually in community components. If a user has local implementations for the `gdb.DB` interface, they should be aware of this change.
    4. Added `Model.Partition` method, allowing users to explicitly specify partition parameters during database operations.
    5. Added `Model.LeftJoinOnFields/RightJoinOnFields/InnerJoinOnFields` methods, making it easier to implement `Join` operations.
    6. Fixed the implementation issue of the `Model.WherePrefixNotIn` method.
8. `gredis`
    1. Added `Cluster` configuration option to specify whether to use cluster mode: [Redis-Configuration Management](../docs/组件列表/NoSQL%20Redis/Redis-配置管理.md)
    2. Added `Protocol` configuration option to specify the `RESP` version: [Redis-Configuration Management](../docs/组件列表/NoSQL%20Redis/Redis-配置管理.md)
9. `gi18n`
    1. Improved translation file reading logic, supporting automatic file reading from resource managers: [I18N Internationalization-Configuration Management](../docs/核心组件/I18N国际化/I18N国际化-配置管理.md)
10. `gclient`
    1. Added `NoUrlEncode` feature, allowing `GET` requests to not automatically perform `UrlEncode` on parameters.
11. `ghttp`
    1. Improved exit signal handling to support graceful exit upon capture of exit signals on the Windows platform.
12. `goai`
    1. Supports automatic recognition of `ghttp.UploadFile` type as `OpenAPIv3` `File` type.
    2. Removed redundant description information from `Path` objects and `Method` objects.
    3. Converts the example field type of the interface into the corresponding data type based on the parameter data type.
13. `gcfg`
    1. Added `AdapterContent` configuration interface implementation, allowing configuration management through specific configuration content: [Configuration Management-AdapterContent](../docs/核心组件/配置管理/配置管理-接口化设计/配置管理-AdapterContent.md)
14. `gctx`
    1. Added `NeverDone` method, which wraps a given `ctx` object and returns a `ctx` object that never expires or is `Cancelled`.
15. `gfile`
    1. Changed the default file creation mode from `0777` to `0755`.
    2. Improved `Copy/CopyFile/CopyDir` methods, added `CopyOption` optional parameter to control the copy logic options.
16. `gmutex`
    1. Improved `gmutex.Mutex` object using `Golang`'s new version of `mutex`, directly utilizing the `TryLock/TryRLock` from the new version standard library. The methods `LockFunc/TryLockFunc` are retained.
    2. Added `gmutex.RWMutex` object, extending the standard library's `sync.RWMutex` object, with new methods `LockFunc/TryLockFunc, RLockFunc/TryRLockFunc`.
17. `gstr`
    1. Added `List2/ListAndTrim2/List3/ListAndTrim3` methods, similar to the `PHP list` functionality, which splits a string and returns it as multiple result values.
    2. Added `CaseConvert` method to perform string naming format conversion according to a given `CaseType` type parameter.
18. `gconv`
    1. Added `ConvertWithRefer` method, which uses the given parameter as a type reference and converts the given parameter to the specified type.
19. `gutil`
    1. Added `FillStructWithDefault` method, which automatically fills the given struct object/pointer with default values by reading the `struct tag`.
20. `gvalid`
    1. Fixed the issue with `enums` validation rule not supporting `map` parameter types.

## Community Components

### Configuration Management

1. Added `contrib/config/consul` component, implemented `consul` service for configuration management component interface: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/config/consul](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/config/consul)

### Database Implementation

1. Improved `contrib/drivers/dm` component:
1. Supports `schema` parameter configuration.
2. Supports `time.Time/*time.Time` time type parameter operations.
2. Improved `contrib/drivers/sqlite` component to support `Insert Ignore` and `Save` operations.
3. Added `contrib/drivers/sqlitecgo` component, supporting `i386` system architecture through `cgo`.
4. Improved `contrib/nosql/redis` component:
1. Added `TLSConfig` configuration to support `TLS` connection to `Redis Server`.
2. Added `Protocol` configuration option to support the latest version of `Redis Server`.

### Service Registration Discovery

1. Added `contrib/registry/nacos` component, implementing microservice registration and discovery using `nacos`: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/registry/nacos](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/contrib/registry/nacos)
2. Improved `contrib/registry/file` component to automatically delete expired registrations, preventing clients from discovering and connecting to expired server addresses.
3. Fixed some implementation issues in the `contrib/registry/polaris` component.

### Microservice Components

1. Improved `contrib/rpc/grpcx` component:
1. Clients support directly providing connection addresses to access the server.
2. Enhanced unit tests to improve code quality.

## Development Tools

1. Improved the installation method of the `cli` tool to additionally support `go install` installation: `go install github.com/gogf/gf/cmd/gf/v2@latest`
2. Improved `gf run` command by adding `WatchPaths/-w` configuration, allowing specified path list monitoring to avoid the `too many opened files` issue caused by monitoring all files in local projects by default: [Auto-Compile-run](../docs/开发工具/自动编译-run.md)
3. Improved `gf gen ctrl` command by adding `Merge/-m` option to control the generation of controller code files according to the `api` layer rather than splitting them into different files based on `api` interfaces: [Interface Specification-gen ctrl](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/接口规范-gen%20ctrl.md)
4. Improved `gf gen dao` command by adding `RemoveFieldPrefix/-rf` option to automatically remove the prefix of generated table field names: [Data Specification-gen dao](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/数据规范-gen%20dao.md)
5. Improved `gf gen pbentity` command by adding `RemoveFieldPrefix/-rf` option to automatically remove the prefix of generated table field names: [Table PB-gen pbentity](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/数据表PB-gen%20pbentity.md)
6. Improved `gf gen service` command to automatically generate method comments for objects in the `logic` module into the `service` interface file.
7. Improved `gf version/gf -v` command for more detailed tool version, runtime environment, and framework information.
8. Improved the initialization efficiency of development tools, removing `init` package method logic that affected initialization efficiency.
9. Fixed the issue of `Link` database configuration failure in the `gf gen dao` command.
10. Other detailed fixes.
