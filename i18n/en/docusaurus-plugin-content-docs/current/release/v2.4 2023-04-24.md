Hello everyone, the `GoFrame` framework has officially released version `v2.4.0` today! 👏👏👏👏

The biggest highlight of this version is the provision of **features for microservices development, development tools, and project scaffolding**, along with comprehensive **microservices development documentation**!! The design of microservices components continues to focus primarily on interface design to ensure good flexibility and extensibility. The interfaces are maintained in the main repository of the framework, while specific interface implementations are pragmatic and provided within community components.

In fact, the feature functionality of this version has long been `Ready`, but due to the significant workload of documentation, it took about a month to complete it relatively thoroughly, thus adjusting the release date of the version accordingly. We believe that documentation is as important as code and is an integral part of a milestone release. We know how to use it well and hope to tell everyone how to use it well, to more pragmatically help more developers. This is one reason why `GoFrame` framework documentation has been able to accumulate abundantly over time. Furthermore, complete source code comments are primarily in English to assist overseas users. The official website documentation remains predominantly in Chinese to support major development teams in the Greater China region.

Come and check out what we've updated! `Enjoy!` 🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺

## New Features

Official release of microservices development features and addition of a complete microservices development section on the official website: [Microservices Development](../docs/微服务开发/微服务开发.md)

## Functional Improvements

### Database Component

1. `gdb`
1. Fixed the issue of automatic table structure query failure during cross-database operations: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2338](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2338)
2. Fixed the `Namespace` configuration issue not taking effect under `pgsql`.
3. Fixed the issue of being unable to open `sqlite` database files when using the new unified configuration: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2435](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2435)
4. Improved underlying database operation return logic, returning underlying errors through `gerror.Wrap` to ensure that the upper layer can obtain underlying custom error objects.
5. Fixed the issue of unsigned integer fields being converted to signed integer types when querying data tables: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2356](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2356)
6. Fixed parsing issue of multi-level `Model` being used as subquery parameters during subqueries: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2339](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2339)
7. Improved time maintenance feature, enabling the writing of full time (granularity down to nanoseconds) for write/update/delete operations.
8. Fixed unlimited execution issue under soft delete scenarios when given an empty `Where` condition: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2427](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2427)
2. `gredis`
1. Fixed configuration handling and object initialization issues when creating objects.

### Container Component

1. `garray`
1. Added `Filter` method for customizing traversal and filtering of array elements.
2. Added `RemoveValues` method to support batch deletion of elements by parameter value.
3. Improved `InsertBefore` method to support batch parameter insertion capability.
2. `gmap`
1. Added `IsSubOf` method to determine if the current `map` is a subset of the specified `map`.
3. `gqueue`
1. Fixed `Len/Size` length calculation issue: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2509](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2509)
2. Fixed concurrent safety issue with `Close` method: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2015](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2015)

### Network Component

1. `gclient`
1. Added `SetDiscovery` and `SetBuilder` methods to allow callers to customize client service discovery and load balancing interface implementations.
2. `ghttp`
1. Improved support for reading specified parameters from `Header/Cookie` when receiving parameters, supporting the specification of reading `Header/Cookie` in the route's `in` tag (`in:header/cookie`).
2. Improved `ResponseWriter` to implement the `http.Flusher` interface, simplifying the user's `Stream` output development logic: [Data Return - Stream Return](../docs/WEB服务开发/数据返回/数据返回-Stream返回.md)
3. Improved link tracing implementation logic to prevent issues from being ignored when an error occurs in reading submitted content internally.
4. Improved parameter reading logic to prevent `r.GetRequestMap()` from returning content that includes `form-data` form `body` information: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2261](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2261)
5. Improved internal context reception logic:
      1. Original logic: Removed ignoring of the underlying `Request` `ctx` and created a new `ctx` supporting link tracing.
      2. Latest logic: Inherits the `ctx` object of the underlying `Request` and extends this `ctx` to support link tracing features.
6. Improved graceful shutdown logic to allow customizing the timeout of graceful shutdown.
7. Improved configuration feature to allow developers to configure custom service registration interface implementation objects.

### System Component

1. `gcmd`
1. Improved `AddObject` method to allow directly adding specified `*Command` or standardized `Object` objects as subcommands.
2. `gctx`
1. Fixed missing `TraceID` issue in `GetInitCtx` method: [Context-gctx](../docs/组件列表/系统相关/上下文-gctx.md)
3. `gfile`
1. Improved `Temp` method to align basic logic implementation with standard library `os.TempDir`, avoiding temporary directory conflict issues during single-machine collaboration.
4. `gtimer`
1. Added `Quick` option when creating timers to trigger the specified callback method upon adding timers.

### Utility Component

1. `gconv`
1. Fixed `Scan` method conversion failure issue in certain scenarios when fields are integer/floating point arrays: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2391](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2391)
2. Fixed issue of `Interfaces` method directly returning `[]` when attribute is 0: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2395](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2395)
3. Fixed conversion issue when `json tag` is `,omitempty` without variable name.
4. Fixed conversion failure issue when target type is a pointer to a custom basic type.
5. Fixed conversion failure issue of `gvar.Var` type to common third-party package `decimal.Decimal` type: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2584](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2584)
6. Improved `Struct` method to resolve conversion failure issue when field type is `time.Time/*time.Time` and provided conversion value is a non-standard library-supported string like `2022-12-15 16:11:34`: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2371](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2371)
2. `gtag`
1. Added `SetGlobalEnums/GetEnumsByType` methods for automated `Golang Enums` management. Requires `gf gen enums` command to work.
3. `gutil`
1. Fixed null pointer error issue in `Dump` method under certain scenarios: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2487](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2487)
4. `gvalid`
1. Added `Field` field in custom validation method parameters to address field missing issues in custom validation error prompts: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2499](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues/2499)

### Community Component

#### Database Driver

1. Improved `dm/mysql` component to resolve `QueryEscape` issue when special characters (e.g., `/`) exist in timezone configuration.

#### NoSQL Adapter

3. Added `gf gen enums` command for parsing specified directory `go` files and automatically generating `enums` data files based on enumeration definition specifications, mainly used for `OpenAPI` interface documentation display (experimental feature): [Enumeration Maintenance-gen enums](../docs/开发工具/代码生成-gen/枚举维护-gen%20enums.md)
4. Improved `gf up` command by adding tool `CLI` automatic upgrade feature.
5. Improved `gf gen service` command to stop auto-generating methods into the interface definition file after the method's comment.
6. Improved `gf build` command by adding `DumpENV` option to control whether to print environment information used during compilation, with default setting off.
7. Improved `gf docker` command by adding `Tag` option to ensure compatibility with older versions.
