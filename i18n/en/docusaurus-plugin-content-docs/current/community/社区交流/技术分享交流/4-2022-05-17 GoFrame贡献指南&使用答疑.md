## Basic Introduction

Hello, community friends!

As the main features of the GoFrame framework become more complete and stable, future efforts will focus on promoting community contributions.

As of 2022-05-17, there are over 1K open source projects using the GoFrame framework on GitHub, and 89 people have contributed to the GoFrame project. Some have become continuous contributors. As the team of contributors grows, our open source project becomes more powerful, stable, open, and vibrant.
