description: 'GoFrame is an open-source, free framework, welcoming all developers to contribute to its code and documentation. Through the main GitHub repository, you can take part in code contribution and be part of our development history. Additionally, you can help promote the GoFrame framework by improving official documentation, writing blogs, or creating videos.'

`GoFrame` is open-source, free software, which means anyone can contribute to its development and progress. The project's source code is currently hosted on both `GitHub` (primary repository) and `gitee` (domestic) platforms, with both repositories kept in real-time synchronization. Code contributions are unified through the primary GitHub repository. We warmly welcome more friends to join in the development of the `GoFrame` framework, and any contributions you make will be recorded in the annals of `GoFrame`.

Contributions can generally be divided into two categories: **code contribution** and **documentation contribution**.

## 1. Code Contribution

### 1. Where to Find Tasks

In the main repository’s `issues`, there are many `issues` labeled with `help wanted`, eagerly awaiting contributions from community members: [Click here for the address](https://github.com/gogf/gf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

### 2. Code Contribution Process

1. First, `fork` the repository code to your own repository.
2. Create a new development branch in your repository, make changes to the code, and submit the changes to your repository.
3. Create a `pull request` in your repository, selecting your development branch as the source branch and the primary repository's `master` branch as the target branch: [https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
4. Submit the `pull request`, then wait for the project developers to do a `code review` on the submission. If the `pull request` is not reviewed for a long time, you can actively follow up and request a `code review` from team members. Once approved, you will become a member of the `GoFrame` framework.
5. Congratulations, your name will be permanently recorded in the list of contributors to the `GoFrame` framework source code.

### 3. Code Collaboration Conventions

1. All source code files, types, and methods should have detailed comments.
2. Explanation of implementation ideas is needed for sections with complex logic.
3. All comments should be written in English, not in Chinese.
4. New features/modules must have unit tests, with coverage exceeding `80%`.

## 2. Documentation Contribution

### 1. Improving the Official Website

The documentation of the `GoFrame` framework is mainly concentrated in the `gf-site` repository, address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf-site](https://github.com/gogf/gf-site)

While reading the documentation, if you find areas that are not quite complete, you can click to edit the page to help improve it. This is especially true for examples on how to use components and functions, which can often be supplemented.

### 2. Blogs and Video Tutorials

Community members can write articles or record videos to share, making it easier for other community members to find your share through search engines, facilitating mutual learning, and promoting open-source projects.

Please keep the framework name keyword unified as `GoFrame` in the articles, and do not use abbreviations.
