description: "Detailed information about the gf command line development tool provided by the GoFrame framework, covering tool responsibilities, considerations, configuration support, tool debugging, and a command overview, among other aspects. The gf tool aims to simplify project development and increase efficiency, and supports parameter configuration through command line and configuration file methods to enhance tool usability."

The `GoFrame` framework provides a powerful `gf` command line development assistance tool, which is an important part of the framework's development. Tool link:

- [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/cmd/gf](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/cmd/gf)

Please refer to the repository page for tool installation. Once the tool is successfully installed, you can view all supported commands with `gf` or `gf -h`. For complex commands, you can view more detailed usage information with `gf COMMAND -h`, for example: `gf gen -h`.

## Tool Responsibilities

1. Simplify project development and improve development efficiency.
2. Support the accurate implementation of framework project design specifications.

## Considerations

1. Some commands require you to have a basic development environment for `Golang` installed. Please refer to the chapter [Environment Installation](../其他资料/准备工作/环境安装.md) for details on environment installation.
2. The latest version of the `CLI` tool will follow the latest version of the framework.

## Configuration Support

**All commands of the tool support configuration parameters through both command line and configuration file simultaneously to improve usability. Command line parameters take precedence; if they are not provided, the tool automatically reads the corresponding parameter names from the configuration file.**

The configuration file path prioritizes the `hack` directory in the current directory (`hack/config.yaml`), and then the framework's default configuration path. For the framework's default configuration file retrieval path, please refer to the chapter: [Configuration Management - File Configuration](../核心组件/配置管理/配置管理-文件配置.md).

Example configuration file format:

```yaml
# GoFrame CLI tool configuration.
gfcli:
  gen:
    dao:
    - link:            "mysql:root:12345678@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/test"
      tables:          "user"
      removePrefix:    "gf_"
      descriptionTag:  true
      noModelComment:  true

  docker:
    build: "-a amd64 -s linux -p temp"
    tagPrefixes:
    - ccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/xxx
    - hkccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/xxx
    - sgccr.ccs.tencentyun.com/xxx
```

Note that the above configuration example is for reference only. Please refer to specific command help for specific configuration items.

## Tool Debugging

When encountering issues during the tool's usage, you can try enabling the tool's debug mode to obtain more detailed execution log information. The debug mode can be enabled with the `debug` command line option, for example:

```bash
gf build main.go --debug
```

Since the `gf` tool is also developed using the `GoFrame` framework, the enabling of debug information is consistent with the framework method. For a more detailed introduction, please refer to the framework introduction document: [Debug Mode](../核心组件/调试模式.md)

## Command Overview

This help document uses `gf cli v2.0.0` as an example for a brief introduction. For detailed introduction information, please refer to the command line help. The information in this chapter may be delayed, so please refer to the tool help for the latest specific introductions.
