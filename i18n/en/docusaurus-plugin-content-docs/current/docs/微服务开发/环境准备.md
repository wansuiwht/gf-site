description: "Prepare the environment for microservices development, mainly including the installation guide of GRPC protocol dependencies and GoFrame framework CLI tools. Learners need to ensure the installation of GRPC related tools and master the basic application of GRPC protocol in the microservices development of the GoFrame framework."

The subsequent microservices chapters mainly focus on the `GRPC` protocol, introducing microservices development, components, and tool usage.

## Dependency Installation

Before further learning, please first understand the relevant concepts of `GRPC` and install the corresponding tools to the local development environment:

- [https://grpc.io/](https://grpc.io/)
- [https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/)

If it's a `MacOS` environment, consider using the `brew` tool to install dependencies:

```bash
brew install grpc protoc-gen-go protoc-gen-go-grpc
```

After installing the dependency tools, please refer to the chapter [https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/) to complete the basic study of the `protoc` tool usage.

## Framework Tools

Please ensure the version of the GoFrame framework CLI development tool is `>= v2.4`. For tool installation and upgrade, please refer to the chapter: [Development Tools](../开发工具/开发工具.md)

The framework tools provide additional command support for the `GRPC` protocol, greatly simplifying the microservices development based on the `GRPC` protocol.
