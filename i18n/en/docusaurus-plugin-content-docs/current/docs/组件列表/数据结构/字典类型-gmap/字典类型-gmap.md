description: "Basic methods and considerations for using the gmap dictionary type in the GoFrame framework. The gmap module provides various concurrent-safe map data structure options, including HashMap, TreeMap, and ListMap. Suitable for any scenario involving concurrent access and hash table operations in Go applications, and details the performance and characteristics of each type."

## Introduction

A `map` container with a concurrent safety switch option, the most commonly used data structure. This module includes `map` containers with multiple data structures: `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `ListMap`.

| Type | Data Structure | Average Complexity | Supports Sorting | Ordered Traversal | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HashMap` | Hash Table | `O(1)` | No | No | High performance read/write operation, high memory usage, random traversal |
| `ListMap` | Hash Table + Doubly Linked List | `O(2)` | No | Yes | Supports traversal in the order of insertion, high memory usage |
| `TreeMap` | Red Black Tree | `O(log N)` | Yes | Yes | Compact memory usage, supports key name sorting and ordered traversal |
:::tip
Additionally, the `gmap` module supports defining common types of `map` with hash table as the underlying data structure: `IntIntMap`, `IntStrMap`, `IntAnyMap`, `StrIntMap`, `StrStrMap`, `StrAnyMap`.

**Usage Scenarios**:

Any `map`/hash table/associative array usage scenario, particularly in concurrent safety scenarios.

**Usage Method**:
