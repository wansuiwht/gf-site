description: "Generate high-performance and easy-to-use global unique numbers with the GUID module of the GoFrame framework. The string generated by GUID consists of numbers and lowercase English characters, with a fixed length of 32 bytes. The document details the mechanism of GUID generation, its usage, and its advantages in various scenarios."

`guid` provides a more convenient and higher performance global unique number generation feature. The generated `uid` string only includes **numbers and lowercase English characters**.

- **Advantages**: High performance, easy to use.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited character range, fixed length of `32` bytes.

> The purpose of designing the `guid` module is to provide a more convenient, higher performance unique number generation that can meet the requirements of most business scenarios. The design of `guid` is relatively simple, and details can be found in the implementation source code.

**Character List**:

```
Character Type  Character List
Numerical Characters  0123456789
English Characters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```

**Usage**:

```go
import "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/util/guid"
```

### Introduction

`guid` generates a `32` byte unique number through the `S` method, which is defined as follows:

```go
func S(data ...[]byte) string
```

1. When used without any parameters, the unique number generated by this method will be composed as follows:

`MACHash(7) + PID(4) + TimestampNano(12) + Sequence(3) + RandomString(6)`

Where:

   - `MAC` represents the MAC address hash of the current machine, consisting of `7` bytes;
   - `PID` represents the process ID of the current machine, consisting of `4` bytes;
   - `TimestampNano` represents the current nanosecond timestamp, consisting of `12` bytes;
   - `Sequence` represents the concurrent safe sequence number of the current process, consisting of `3` bytes;
   - `RandomString` represents a random string, consisting of `6` bytes;
2. When using any custom parameters, the unique number generated by this method will be composed as follows:

`DataHash(7/14) + TimestampNano(12) + Sequence(3) + RandomString(3/10)`

Main Points:

   - `Data` represents custom parameters, with a type of `[]byte`, supporting up to `2` input parameters, consisting of `7` or `14` bytes;
   - Note that the input custom parameters need to have some unique identification in the business context, making the generated unique number more valuable;
   - Regardless of the length of each `[]byte` parameter, they will eventually generate a `7` byte hash value through a hash method.
   - `TimestampNano` represents the current nanosecond timestamp, consisting of `12` bytes;
   - `Sequence` represents the concurrent safe sequence number of the current process, consisting of `3` bytes;
   - `RandomString` represents a random string, consisting of `3` or `10` bytes, that is:
     - If `1` custom parameter is given, the remaining bytes will be filled with random numbers, with a length of `10` bytes;
     - If `2` custom parameters are given, the remaining bytes will be filled with random numbers, with a length of `3` bytes;

### Example 1, Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/util/guid"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("TraceId: %s", guid.S())
}
```

After execution, the output will be:

```
TraceId: oa9sdw03dk0c35q9bdwcnz42p00trwfr
```

### Example 2, Custom Parameters

Our `SessionId` generation needs to have good uniqueness and prevent easy collisions, so the following method can be used:

```go
func CreateSessionId(r *ghttp.Request) string {
    var (
        address = request.RemoteAddr
        header  = fmt.Sprintf("%v", request.Header)
    )
    return guid.S([]byte(address), []byte(header))
}
```

As you can see, `SessionId` relies on two custom input parameters `RemoteAddr` and `Header` to generate, and these two parameters have a certain unique identification in the business context. The design of the `guid.S` method ensures that the generated unique number will be extremely random and unique, meeting business needs and ensuring safety.
