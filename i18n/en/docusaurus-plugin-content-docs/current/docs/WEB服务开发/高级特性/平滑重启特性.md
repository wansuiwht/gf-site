description: "Enable and manage graceful restart features while using the GoFrame framework. This feature allows the WebServer to update or restart without interrupting existing requests, improving service stability and user experience. It supports graceful restart on *nix systems and complete restart on Windows systems, and provides management methods via web and command line. It also demonstrates specific usage examples, including basic usage, HTTPS support, and smooth management in multi-service and multi-port scenarios."
---

`Smooth restart` (`hot reload`) means the `WebServer` can restart without interrupting existing request execution. This feature is especially useful during different project version releases. For instance, when needing to release two versions: `A` and `B`, during the execution of `A`, we can directly overwrite `A`'s program with `B` and use the graceful restart feature (using `Web` or `command line`) to seamlessly transition requests to the new version of the service.

The `GoFrame` framework supports very convenient `web management features`, which means we can directly manage `Server` restart/shutdown operations through a web page/API. Additionally, the framework also supports `Server` restart/shutdown operations through `command line terminal commands` (limited to `*nix` systems).

## Feature Activation

By default, the graceful restart feature is disabled, and it can be turned on via the `graceful` configuration option. Please refer to the `WebServer` configuration management section for details: [Service Configuration-Config File Template](../服务配置/服务配置-配置文件模板.md)
:::tip
Currently, the graceful restart feature requires randomly opening a TCP listening service on a local port for communication and state information exchange between new and old processes.
:::
## Notes

- This feature is limited to `*nix` systems (`Linux/Unix/FreeBSD`, etc.), and on `Windows`, it only supports complete restart (requests cannot transition smoothly).
- Please do not use `IDE run` (e.g., `Goland`) or the `go run` command to run processes when testing the graceful restart feature, as these methods create a parent process to manage the running `Go` process, which can cause failures in state exchange between child and parent processes during a graceful restart.
- The `SetGraceful` configuration method in the subsequent examples is newly added after version `v2.7.4`. For versions below `v2.7.4`, please use the configuration management method to enable the graceful restart feature.

## Management Methods

First, let's look at the management methods involved in the WebServer:

```go

          func (s *Server) Restart
          (newExeFilePath...
          string
          ) error
func (s *Server) Shutdown
          (
          ) error

func (s *Server) EnableAdmin
          (pattern ...
          string
          )


```

`Restart` is used to restart the service (graceful restart on `*nix` systems, complete restart on `Windows`), `Shutdown` is used to close the service, and `EnableAdmin` is used to register the management page with the specified routing rules. The default address is `/debug/admin` (we can specify a private management address or use middleware to authenticate the page).

The following details two of these methods.

### Restart

The `Restart` parameter can specify the custom executable file path for restart (`newExeFilePath`). If not provided, it defaults to the original executable file path. Especially under the Windows system, when the executable file is in use, it cannot be replaced or updated (new version file replacing the old version file). By specifying a custom executable file path, when the `Server` restarts, it will execute the new version of the executable file instead of the old one, simplifying the version update process on some systems.

### EnableAdmin

- Firstly, this method provides users with a convenient page and API for managing the `Server`, which is very convenient for managing a single `Server`. By directly accessing and clicking the corresponding links on the management page, operations can be performed. It is important to note that, due to the management features, if used in production environments, it is recommended to customize the management address to a private address.
- Additionally, the `restart` API provided by `EnableAdmin` also supports custom executable file paths, directly passing the `newExeFilePath` variable to the restart API through GET parameters, e.g., [http://127.0.0.1/debug/admin/restart?newExeFilePath=xxxxxxx](http://127.0.0.1/debug/admin/restart?newExeFilePath=xxxxxxx)
- Furthermore, in most cases, `Server` often has more than 1 node, so in most service management operations, such as restart operations, it is not directly accessing the `admin` page of each `Server` to manually execute the restart operation. Instead, it fully utilizes the functional APIs provided by the `admin` page to achieve unified `Server` management control through API control.

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "time"

    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gproc"
)

func main() {
    s := g.Server()
    s.BindHandler("/", func(r *ghttp.Request) {
        r.Response.Writeln("Hello!")
    })
    s.BindHandler("/pid", func(r *ghttp.Request) {
        r.Response.Writeln(gproc.Pid())
    })
    s.BindHandler("/sleep", func(r *ghttp.Request) {
        r.Response.Writeln(gproc.Pid())
        time.Sleep(10 * time.Second)
        r.Response.Writeln(gproc.Pid())
    })
    s.SetGraceful(true)
    s.EnableAdmin()
    s.SetPort(8199)
    s.Run()
}
```

We test graceful restart through the following steps:

1. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8199/pid](http://127.0.0.1:8199/pid) to view the current process pid

![](/markdown/7b28a1e44a96f3410e3e9a6d53a59523.png)

2. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8199/sleep](http://127.0.0.1:8199/sleep), this page will execute for 10 seconds, used for testing whether the page request execution will be interrupted during a restart

![](/markdown/1f7d22a5a51104abc7ad80b2181e3fc6.png)

3. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8199/debug/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8199/debug/admin), which is a WebServer management page registered by default after `s.EnableAdmin`

![](/markdown/8e54c1d520f7856a88e951e3391e1f3b.png)

4. Then we click the `restart` management link, and the WebServer will immediately smoothly restart (on `*nix` systems)

![](/markdown/67eeff6f5cd3e726e24dfc17a5128db4.png)

Meanwhile, the terminal will output the following information:

```shell
                2018-05-18 11:02:04.812 11511: http server started listening on [:8199]
    2018-05-18 11:02:09.172 11511: server reloading
    2018-05-18 11:02:09.172 11511: all servers shutdown
    2018-05-18 11:02:09.176 16358: http server restarted listening on [:8199]


```

5. We can observe that during the entire operation, the execution of the `sleep` page was not interrupted, and after waiting a few seconds, when the `sleep` execution is finished, the page output is:

![](/markdown/e21dfd1e4d9c4cd0a8e4ce042dc5dcaf.png)

6. It can be found that the process pid output on the `sleep` page is different from before, indicating that the request's execution was smoothly taken over by the new process, and the old service process was subsequently destroyed;

### Example 2: HTTPS Support

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
)

func main() {
    s := g.Server()
    s.BindHandler("/", func(r *ghttp.Request){
        r.Response.Writeln("Hello!")
    })
    s.SetGraceful(true)
    s.EnableHTTPS("/home/john/temp/server.crt", "/home/john/temp/server.key")
    s.EnableAdmin()
    s.SetPort(8200)
    s.Run()
}
```

The graceful restart feature of the `GoFrame` framework is also very user-friendly and simple for HTTPS support. The operation steps are as follows:

1. Visit [https://127.0.0.1:8200/debug/admin/restart](https://127.0.0.1:8200/debug/admin/restart) to smoothly restart the HTTPS service;
2. Visit [https://127.0.0.1:8200/debug/admin/shutdown](https://127.0.0.1:8200/debug/admin/shutdown) to smoothly shut down the WebServer service;

The following output information can be seen in the command line terminal:

```shell
        2018-05-18 11:13:05.554 17278: https server started listening on [:8200]
2018-05-18 11:13:21.270 17278: server reloading
2018-05-18 11:13:21.270 17278: all servers shutdown
2018-05-18 11:13:21.278 17319: https server reloaded listening on [:8200]
2018-05-18 11:13:34.895 17319: server shutting down
2018-05-18 11:13:34.895 17269: all servers shutdown


```

### Example 3: Multi-Service and Multi-Port

The graceful restart feature of the `GoFrame` framework is quite powerful and stable, supporting not only single service and single port listening management but also complex scenarios involving multi-service and multi-port listening management.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
)

func main() {
    s1 := g.Server("s1")
    s1.SetGraceful(true)
    s1.EnableAdmin()
    s1.SetPort(8100, 8200)
    s1.Start()

    s2 := g.Server("s2")
    s2.SetGraceful(true)
    s2.EnableAdmin()
    s2.SetPort(8300, 8400)
    s2.Start()

    g.Wait()
}
```

The example above demonstrates two WebServers, `s1` and `s2`, respectively listening on `8100`, `8200`, and `8300`, `8400`. We then visit [http://127.0.0.1:8100/debug/admin/reload](http://127.0.0.1:8100/debug/admin/reload) to smoothly restart the service, and then `http://127.0.0.1:8100/debug/admin/shutdown](http://127.0.0.1:8100/debug/admin/shutdown) to smoothly shut down the service. The final information printed in the terminal is as follows:

```html
2018-05-18 11:26:54.729 18111: http server started listening on [:8400]
2018-05-18 11:26:54.729 18111: http server started listening on [:8100]
2018-05-18 11:26:54.729 18111: http server started listening on [:8300]
2018-05-18 11:26:54.729 18111: http server started listening on [:8200]
2018-05-18 11:27:08.203 18111: server reloading
2018-05-18 11:27:08.203 18111: all servers shutdown
2018-05-18 11:27:08.207 18124: http server reloaded listening on [:8300]
2018-05-18 11:27:08.207 18124: http server reloaded listening on [:8400]
2018-05-18 11:27:08.207 18124: http server reloaded listening on [:8200]
2018-05-18 11:27:08.207 18124: http server reloaded listening on [:8100]
2018-05-18 11:27:19.379 18124: server shutting down
2018-05-18 11:27:19.380 18102: all servers shutdown
```

## Command Line Management

Apart from providing `Web` management capabilities, the `GoFrame` framework also supports management via command line, as the command line uses `signals` for management.

### Restart Service

Use the `SIGUSR1` signal, usage:

```shell

          kill -SIGUSR1 process ID

```

### Shut Down Service

Use any one of the `SIGINT/SIGQUIT/SIGKILL/SIGHUP/SIGTERM` signals, usage:

```shell

          kill -SIGTERM process ID

```

## Other Management Methods

Since the `WebServer` of the `GoFrame` framework adopts a singleton design, the corresponding `Server` singleton object can be obtained anywhere through `g.Server(name)`, and then managed using the `Restart` and `Shutdown` methods.
