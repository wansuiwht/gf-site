description: "Utilize the Server object of the GoFrame framework for service configuration, supporting configuration through a configuration file, including address, log settings, and upload limits, etc. It provides detailed explanations on how to obtain configurations for singleton objects, default values, and methods for multi-configuration management, helping users optimize service configuration strategies."

`Server` objects support convenient configuration through configuration files. Please refer to the API documentation for supported configuration options and explanations; the documentation provides detailed information, and the following sections will not introduce configuration options.

When using `g.Server(singleton name)` to obtain a `Server` singleton object, it will automatically obtain the corresponding `Server` configuration through the default configuration management object. By default, it reads the `server.singleton name` configuration item, and if that does not exist, it will read the `server` configuration item.

For supported configuration file options, refer to the `Server` configuration management object properties: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp#ServerConfig](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp#ServerConfig)

## Example 1, Default Configuration Items

```yaml
server:
    address:    ":80"
    serverRoot: "/var/www/Server"
```

Later, you can use `g.Server()` to automatically obtain and set this configuration when acquiring the default singleton object.
:::warning
If `address` is not configured, the `http server` will start using all `ip` addresses of the local network card plus a **random free port** (default configuration `:0`). If you want to specify an `ip` but start the `http server` with a random free port, you can configure `address` in the format of `ip:0`, for example: `192.168.1.1:0, 10.0.1.1:0`.
:::
## Example 2, Multiple Configuration Items

Example for multiple `Server` configurations:

```yaml
server:
    address:    ":80"
    serverRoot: "/var/www/Server"
    server1:
        address:    ":8080"
        serverRoot: "/var/www/Server1"
    server2:
        address:    ":8088"
        serverRoot: "/var/www/Server2"
```

We can obtain the corresponding `Server` singleton object through the singleton object name:

```go
// Corresponding to server.server1 configuration item
s1 := g.Server("server1")
// Corresponding to server.server2 configuration item
s2 := g.Server("server2")
// Corresponding to default configuration item server
s3 := g.Server("none")
// Corresponding to default configuration item server
s4 := g.Server()
```

## Example 3, More Complete Example

For example, for the example in the previous section, the corresponding configuration file is as follows:

```yaml
server:
    address:          ":8199"
    serverRoot:       "/var/www/Server"
    indexFiles:       ["index.html", "main.html"]
    accessLogEnabled: true
    errorLogEnabled:  true
    pprofEnabled:     true
    logPath:          "/var/log/ServerLog"
    sessionIdName:    "MySessionId"
    sessionPath:      "/tmp/MySessionStoragePath"
    sessionMaxAge:    "24h"
    dumpRouterMap:    false
```

Similarly, the names of configuration property items are not case-sensitive, and it also supports using `-`/`_` symbols to connect words. That means the following configuration file has the same effect as the above one:

```yaml
server:
    address:          ":8199"
    serverRoot:       "/var/www/Server"
    indexFiles:       ["index.html", "main.html"]
    accessLogEnabled: true
    errorLogEnabled:  true
    pprofEnabled:     true
    log-path:         "/var/log/ServerLog"
    session_Id_Name:  "MySessionId"
    Session-path:     "/tmp/MySessionStoragePath"
    session_MaxAge:   "24h"
    DumpRouterMap:    false
```
:::tip
We recommend using camelCase format for configuration item names in configuration files.

## Upload Limit

`Server` has size limits for data submitted by clients, controlled by two main configuration parameters:

- `MaxHeaderBytes`: Request header size limit, the request header includes `Cookie` data submitted by the client, default is `10KB`.
- `ClientMaxBodySize`: Body size limit submitted by the client, also affecting file upload size, default is `8MB`.

Due to security considerations, the default upload limits are not very high, especially the size limit of `ClientMaxBodySize`. In scenarios where file uploads are needed, you may consider adjusting, and it can be configured through a configuration file, for example:

```yaml
server:
    maxHeaderBytes:    "20KB"
    clientMaxBodySize: "200MB"
```

This way, the request header size limit is modified to `20KB`, and the file upload size limit is `200MB`. If you do not want to impose any limit on the upload size, set `clientMaxBodySize` to `0`.

## Log Configuration

Starting from version `v2`, `Server` added support for `Logger` configuration item in configuration files, mainly to unify log component configuration and solve log rolling split issues. Configuration example:

```yaml
server:
    address: ":8080"
    logger:
        path:                 "/var/log/server"
        file:                 "{Y-m-d}.log"
        stdout:               false
        rotateSize:           "100M"
        rotateBackupLimit:    10
        rotateBackupExpire:   "60d"
        rotateBackupCompress: 9
        rotateCheckInterval:  "24h"
```
