## How to Modify Request Parameters through Middleware

Before learning how to modify request parameters, please first understand some details about request parameter input: [Request Input🔥](../../请求输入/请求输入.md)

### Custom Parameter Overriding

The simplest way to modify request parameters is to override client-submitted parameters through **custom parameters**. Since custom parameters have the highest priority in parameter parsing, when *fully retrieving request parameters* (not through specific submission methods), custom parameters will override parameters submitted by other methods. This method of modification is common, especially when using standard routing, where parameters are received as a `struct` object, and the underlying layer retrieves all parameters and then converts them to a `struct` object.

However, if the user obtains parameters through `r.GetQuery, r.GetForm`, custom parameter overriding will be ineffective. Methods like `r.Get` or `r.GetRequest` for parameter retrieval can also achieve parameter overriding effects.

### Modifying Parameters for Specific Request Methods

It's also possible to modify the original parameters in middleware by altering `r.URL.RawQuery` or `r.Body`, but after modification, it's necessary to call `r.ReloadParams()` to indicate that the request parameters will need to be re-parsed in the next retrieval.

## Precautions for Modifying Request Body through Middleware

A common issue when modifying `r.Body` through middleware is that `r.Body` can only be read once, and subsequent reads will not retrieve the data, which is by the design of the standard library `http.Request`. In the `GoFrame` framework's `ghttp.Request` object, continuous reading of the `Body` content is allowed using the framework's `ghttp.Request` `GetBody`, `GetBodyString` methods.

However, if you directly read `r.Body` using the standard library's `http.Request` object within middleware, it is recommended to reassign `r.Body` or wrap and reassign it using `io.NopCloser` to facilitate further reading of `Body` content by subsequent middleware or processes.
