description: "Use the HTTP client feature in the GoFrame framework to obtain and print raw input and output information of HTTP requests. The main methods include Raw, RawDump, RawRequest, and RawResponse, which are useful for debugging HTTP requests. The example demonstrates the method of sending POST requests using the GoFrame framework and printing the request and response."

## Introduction

The `http` client supports obtaining and printing the raw input and output information of HTTP requests, which is convenient for debugging. The related methods are as follows:

```go
func (r *Response) Raw() string
func (r *Response) RawDump()
func (r *Response) RawRequest() string
func (r *Response) RawResponse() string
```

As you can see, all methods are bound to the `Response` object, which means they can only be printed after the request is completed.

## Usage Example

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
)

func main() {
    response, err := g.Client().Post(
        gctx.New(),
        "https://goframe.org",
        g.Map{
            "name": "john",
        },
    )
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    response.RawDump()
}
```

After execution, the terminal output is:

```
