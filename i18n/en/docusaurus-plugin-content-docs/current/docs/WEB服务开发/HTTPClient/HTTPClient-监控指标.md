description: "The monitoring metrics feature of the HTTP client is disabled by default to avoid performance impact. It provides a variety of metrics for users to reference, such as the time cost of request execution, connection creation time, and the total size of request bytes, among others. These metrics are enabled only when the metric feature is globally enabled, helping users perform better performance analysis."

The `HTTP` client supports monitoring capabilities, which are off by default to avoid performance impact. The monitoring and metrics calculation features are enabled by default only when the global `metric` feature is activated.
