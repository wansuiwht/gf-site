## Should I preserve and reuse the created `gclient.Client` object?

Whether you create a `gclient.Client` object through `g.Client` or the `gclient.New` method, this object should be preserved and reused instead of creating a new `Client` object each time. This approach can improve efficiency, reduce resource usage, and be friendly to `GC`. The object has a built-in connection pool design that can effectively manage a large number of short connection requests. Due to the fact that the `Client` object does not consume a lot of resources, many people might not pay much attention to this point.

In what situations should I create a new `gclient.Client` object instead of reusing it? You can follow the decoupling design of business modules, where each business module manages its own `gclient.Client` object. Alternatively, when different scenarios require different configurations of the `Client`, you can create different `Client` objects to use.

## `invalid semicolon separator in query`

**Cause of the problem**: By default, **form requests** containing the `;` character are illegal (need `urlencode`). For details, please refer to the discussion: [https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25192](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25192)

**Error Example**:

```bash
curl localhost:8000/Execute -d '{
    "Component": "mysql",
    "ResourceId": "cdb-gy6hm0ee",
    "Port": 6379,
    "SQL": "show databases;",
    "UserName": "root",
    "Password": ""
}'
```

**Corrected Example**:

When submitting the request, you need to specify the `ContentType`; for example, here it should indicate a `JSON` request.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8000/Execute -d '{
    "Component": "mysql",
    "ResourceId": "cdb-gy6hm0ee",
    "Port": 6379,
    "SQL": "show databases;",
    "UserName": "root",
    "Password": ""
}'
```
