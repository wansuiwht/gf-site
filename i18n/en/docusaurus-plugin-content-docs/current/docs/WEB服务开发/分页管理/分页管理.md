## Introduction

Pagination management is implemented by the `gpage` module. `gpage` offers powerful dynamic and static pagination functionalities and provides developers with high flexibility in customizing pagination styles.

:::tip
The `gpage` module is primarily used for generating HTML code for pagination, commonly used in `MVC` development scenarios.
:::

**Usage:**

```go
import "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/util/gpage"
```

**API Documentation:**

[https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/util/gpage](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/util/gpage)

**Pagination Object:**

```go
// Page is the pagination implementer.
// All the attributes are public, you can change them when necessary.
type Page struct {
    TotalSize      int    // Total size.
    TotalPage      int    // Total page, which is automatically calculated.
    CurrentPage    int    // Current page number >= 1.
    UrlTemplate    string // Custom url template for page url producing.
    LinkStyle      string // CSS style name for HTML link tag <a>.
    SpanStyle      string // CSS style name for HTML span tag <span>, which is used for first, current and last page tag.
    SelectStyle    string // CSS style name for HTML select tag <select>.
    NextPageTag    string // Tag name for next p.
    PrevPageTag    string // Tag name for prev p.
    FirstPageTag   string // Tag name for first p.
    LastPageTag    string // Tag name for last p.
    PrevBarTag     string // Tag string for prev bar.
    NextBarTag     string // Tag string for next bar.
    PageBarNum     int    // Page bar number for displaying.
    AjaxActionName string // Ajax function name. Ajax is enabled if this attribute is not empty.
}
```

## Creating Pagination Objects

Since pagination objects are often used in `Web` services, starting from version `v1.12` of the framework, we provide a more convenient way to create pagination objects. Pagination objects are integrated into the `ghttp.Request` object, allowing you to easily obtain pagination objects through the `Request.GetPage` method. The method is defined as follows:

```go
func (r *Request) GetPage(totalSize, pageSize int) *gpage.Page
```

As you can see, to obtain a pagination object, you only need to pass the total number and page quantity. Of course, pagination objects can also be used independently. Due to space limitations, we only introduce the most commonly used and simplest method here.

Please refer to subsequent chapters for specific usage examples.

## Predefined Pagination Styles

The `GetContent` method provides predefined common pagination styles for developers to use quickly. When predefined styles do not meet the developers' needs, they can use open methods to customize pagination styles (or override methods for customization) or use regular expressions to replace certain parts of the predefined pagination style for customization.

Please refer to subsequent chapters for specific usage examples.

## Using Ajax Pagination Feature

The `AjaxActionName` attribute of the pagination object is used to specify an `Ajax` method name for implementing `Ajax` pagination. However, it should be noted that this `Ajax` method name needs to be consistently agreed upon between the front and backend, and the `Ajax` method should have only one URL parameter. Below is an example of a client-side definition of an `Ajax` method:

```
function DoAjax(url) {
    // Read the content of the URL here and display it according to business logic
}
```

Please refer to subsequent chapters for specific usage examples.
