Additionally, this article explores how to efficiently maintain enum values in cross-service calls and front-end and back-end collaboration, providing methods using OpenAPI standard protocols and related tools."

## Implementing Enum Values in Go

The `Go` language does not provide an `enum` definition, but we can use `const` to simulate enum types, which is a conventional practice in `Go`.

For example, in the `Kubernetes` project, there are numerous "enum values" defined in the form of constants:

```go
// PodPhase is a label for the condition of a pod at the current time.
type PodPhase string

// These are the valid statuses of pods.
const (
    // PodPending means the pod has been accepted by the system, but one or more of the containers
    // has not been started. This includes time before being bound to a node, as well as time spent
    // pulling images onto the host.
    PodPending PodPhase = "Pending"
    // PodRunning means the pod has been bound to a node and all of the containers have been started.
    // At least one container is still running or is in the process of being restarted.
    PodRunning PodPhase = "Running"
    // PodSucceeded means that all containers in the pod have voluntarily terminated
    // with a container exit code of 0, and the system is not going to restart any of these containers.
    PodSucceeded PodPhase = "Succeeded"
    // PodFailed means that all containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has
    // terminated in a failure (exited with a non-zero exit code or was stopped by the system).
    PodFailed PodPhase = "Failed"
    // PodUnknown means that for some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due
    // to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.
    PodUnknown PodPhase = "Unknown"
)
```

## How to Efficiently Maintain Enum Values Across Services

It is relatively simple to use enum values internally within a project, as they can be defined and used internally. However, when it comes to cross-service calls or front-end and back-end collaboration, efficiency tends to be lower. When services need to demonstrate interface capabilities to external callers, an `API` interface document (or interface definition file, such as `proto`) often needs to be generated, and the client `SDK` for calling is often generated based on the interface document (file).

If it's an interface definition file, like `proto`, the problem can often be resolved by directly viewing the source code, so it's not a big issue. Here, we mainly discuss the problem of maintaining enum values in interface documents, particularly when maintaining enum values through the `OpenAPI` standard protocol during front-end and back-end collaboration. We provide specialized tools for maintaining these enum values, please refer to the chapter: [Enum Maintenance - gen enums](../开发工具/代码生成-gen/枚举维护-gen%20enums.md)
