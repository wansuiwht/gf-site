This section is a hands-on tutorial for installing the `Golang` development environment and `IDE` configuration, specifically for Golang newbies. Experienced users may skip this.

## Go Development Environment Installation

### Step 1 - Download Go Development Package

Visit the Go domestic mirror site download page [https://golang.google.cn/dl/](https://golang.google.cn/dl/), and select your current system version from the versions at the top of the page to download the latest version of the Go development package:

### Step 2 - Installation Guide

Visit the official installation introduction page [https://golang.google.cn/doc/install](https://golang.google.cn/doc/install), and follow the corresponding installation process according to your current system version.

For Windows (`msi`) and MacOS (`pkg`), it is recommended to install using the package. The author's current installation process for the MacOS package (`pkg`) is shown below:

The upgrade process for Go development package is the same.

## IDE Development Environment Installation

Currently, there are two popular `Go` IDEs: `VSCode+Plugins` (free) and `JetBrains`'s `Goland` (paid). As `JetBrains` is also a sponsor of the `GoFrame` framework, we recommend using `Goland` as the development IDE. For download and registration, please refer to online tutorials ([Baidu](https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=goland%20安装) or [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=goland+安装)).

`JetBrains` official website: [https://www.jetbrains.com](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=GoFrame)

### Using Goland

Let's create the first `Go` program, following the usual convention with `hello world`.

#### Step 1. Open IDE

#### Step 2. Create Project

Note the `Go` installation file path (`SDK`), which is thoroughly explained in the [official installation documentation](https://golang.google.cn/doc/install), so please read it carefully.

The `Location` can be any local path you choose.

#### Step 3. Create Program

Create a new `go` file named `hello.go` and input the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world!")
}
```
