description: "How to support custom context variables through ORM in the GoFrame framework to achieve asynchronous IO control, trace, nested transactions, etc. With the Ctx method, developers can easily pass custom context variables to achieve more complex request control and tracing. The article provides specific examples and recommendations for request timeout control and model context operations."

`ORM` supports passing custom `context` variables for asynchronous `IO` control, context information transmission (especially transmission of trace information), and nested transaction support.

We can pass custom context variables to an `ORM` object using the `Ctx` method. The `Ctx` method is essentially a chainable operation, and the context passed in is only effective for the current `DB` interface object. The method is defined as follows:

```go
func Ctx(ctx context.Context) DB
```

## Request Timeout Control

Let's look at an example of controlling the request timeout duration using context variables.

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), time.Second)
defer cancel()
_, err := db.Ctx(ctx).Query("SELECT SLEEP(10)")
fmt.Println(err)
```

In this example, executing `sleep 10` seconds will inevitably cause a timeout. After execution, the output is:

```html
context deadline exceeded, SELECT SLEEP(10)
```

## Trace Information

Context variables can also pass trace information, and when combined with the logging component, can print trace information to logs (only when `ORM` logging is enabled). Please refer to the trace topic chapter: [Service Trace](../../服务可观测性/服务链路跟踪/服务链路跟踪.md).

## Model Context Operations

Model objects also support context variable passing, using the `Ctx` method as well. Let's look at a simple example by modifying the example from the second section using model operations.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
)

func main() {
    _, err := g.DB().Model("user").Ctx(gctx.New()).All()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

After execution, the terminal output is:

```html
2020-12-28 23:46:56.349 [DEBU] {38d45cbf2743db16f1062074f7473e5c} [  5 ms] [default] [rows:0  ] SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM `user`
2020-12-28 23:46:56.354 [DEBU] {38d45cbf2743db16f1062074f7473e5c} [  5 ms] [default] [rows:100] SELECT * FROM `user`
```
:::tip
The `SHOW FULL COLUMNS FROM `user`` query is used by the `ORM` component to fetch data table fields, which queries each table only once before execution and caches the results in memory.

## Nested Transaction Support

Support for nested transactions relies on hierarchical passing of `Context` variables. For details, please refer to the chapter: [ORM Transaction Handling](ORM事务处理/ORM事务处理.md).
