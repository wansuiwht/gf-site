## Introduction

`gdb` chaining operation is simple and flexible, and is the officially recommended database operation method by the `GoFrame` framework. Chaining operation can be done by using the `db.Model` method of the database object or the `tx.Model` method of the transaction object, which returns a chaining operation object `*Model` based on the specified data table. This object can perform the following methods. The current method list may lag behind the source code; for a detailed method list, please refer to the API documentation: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/database/gdb#Model](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/database/gdb#Model)
