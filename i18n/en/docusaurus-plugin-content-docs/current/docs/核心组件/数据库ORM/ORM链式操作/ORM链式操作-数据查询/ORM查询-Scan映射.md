description: "Techniques for using the Scan method for ORM queries in the GoFrame framework, mainly including how to convert query results to struct objects and struct arrays. Illustrated with example code demonstrating the usage of the Scan method, such as converting a single record to a struct object and multiple records to a struct array, helping users effectively handle database query results."

The `Scan` method supports converting query results into a struct or struct array. The `Scan` method will automatically identify the type of conversion to execute based on the given parameter type.

## `struct` Object

The `Scan` method supports converting query results into a `struct` object. The query result should be a specific single record, and the `pointer` parameter should be the pointer address of the `struct` object (`*struct` or `**struct`). For example:

```go
type User struct {
    Id         int
    Passport   string
    Password   string
    NickName   string
    CreateTime *gtime.Time
}
user := User{}
g.Model("user").Where("id", 1).Scan(&user)
```

Or

```go
var user = User{}
g.Model("user").Where("id", 1).Scan(&user)
```

The first two methods pre-initialize the object (allocate memory in advance), while the recommended method is:

```go
var user *User
g.Model("user").Where("id", 1).Scan(&user)
```

This method initializes and allocates memory only when data is queried. Note the difference in usage, especially the difference in parameter types (the first two methods pass a `*User` type, while this method actually passes a `**User` type).

## `struct` Array

The `Scan` method supports converting multiple query results into a `[]struct/[]*struct` array. The query result should be a result set composed of multiple records, and the `pointer` should be the pointer address of the array. For example:

```go
var users []User
g.Model("user").Scan(&users)
```

Or

```go
var users []*User
g.Model("user").Scan(&users)
```
