description: "Configuration management functionality of the log component in the GoFrame framework, including how to manage Logger objects through configuration files and configuration methods. The log component supports multiple configuration formats, and its modular design allows independent log output configuration. Configuration items cover log paths, output levels, and terminal displays, with log levels supporting multiple modes to ensure flexible recording of information at each level."

The log component is one of the core components of the `GoFrame` framework, supporting convenient configuration management capabilities.

## Configuration File (Recommended)
:::tip
The log configuration uses the unified configuration component of the framework, supporting multiple file formats, as well as configuration centers and interface-based extensions. For more details, please refer to the section: [Configuration Management](../配置管理/配置管理.md)
:::
The log component supports configuration files. When using `g.Log(instance name)` to obtain the `Logger` instance object, it will automatically obtain the corresponding `Logger` configuration through the default configuration management object. By default, it will read the `logger.instance name` configuration item. If this configuration item does not exist, it will read the default `logger` configuration item. Please refer to the configuration object structure definition for configuration items: [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/glog#Config](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/glog#Config)

The complete configuration file configuration items and descriptions are as follows, with configuration item names being case-insensitive:

```yaml
logger:
  path:                  "/var/log/"           # Log file path. Default is empty, indicating closed, only output to terminal
  file:                  "{Y-m-d}.log"         # Log file format. Default is "{Y-m-d}.log"
  prefix:                ""                    # Prefix for log content output. Default is empty
  level:                 "all"                 # Log output level
  timeFormat:            "2006-01-02T15:04:05" # Custom log output time format, configured using Golang's standard time format
  ctxKeys:               []                    # Custom Context variable names, automatically print Context variables to the log. Default is empty
  header:                true                  # Whether to print the header information of the log. Default is true
  stdout:                true                  # Whether the log is also output to the terminal. Default is true
  rotateSize:            0                     # Rotate files based on log file size. Default is 0, indicating that the rotation feature is turned off
  rotateExpire:          0                     # Rotate files based on log file time interval. Default is 0, indicating that the rotation feature is turned off
  rotateBackupLimit:     0                     # Clean up split files according to the number of split files, effective when the rotation feature is turned on. Default is 0, meaning no backup, delete when split
  rotateBackupExpire:    0                     # Clean up split files according to the validity period of split files, effective when the rotation feature is turned on. Default is 0, meaning no backup, delete when split
  rotateBackupCompress:  0                     # Compression ratio of rotated split files (0-9). Default is 0, meaning no compression
  rotateCheckInterval:   "1h"                  # Time detection interval for rotation splitting, generally does not need to be set. Default is 1 hour
  stdoutColorDisabled:   false                 # Disable color printing on the terminal. Default is enabled
  writerColorEnable:     false                 # Whether the log file is colored. Default is false, indicating no color
```

Among them, the `level` configuration item is configured using a string and supports the following configurations according to log levels: `DEBU` < `INFO` < `NOTI` < `WARN` < `ERRO` < `CRIT`, and also supports common deployment mode configuration names such as `ALL`, `DEV`, `PROD`. The `level` configuration item string is not case-sensitive. For a detailed introduction to log levels, please refer to the section [Log Component - Log Levels](日志组件-日志级别.md).

### Example 1, Default Configuration Items

```yaml
logger:
  path:    "/var/log"
  level:   "all"
  stdout:  false
```

Then you can use `g.Log()` to automatically obtain and set this configuration when getting the default instance object.

### Example 2, Multiple Configuration Items

An example of configuration for multiple `Logger`:

```yaml
logger:
  path:    "/var/log"
  level:   "all"
  stdout:  false
  logger1:
    path:    "/var/log/logger1"
    level:   "dev"
    stdout:  false
  logger2:
    path:    "/var/log/logger2"
    level:   "prod"
    stdout:  true
```

We can obtain the corresponding configured `Logger` instance objects by the instance object name:

```go
// Corresponding to logger.logger1 configuration item
l1 := g.Log("logger1")
// Corresponding to logger.logger2 configuration item
l2 := g.Log("logger2")
// Corresponding to default configuration item logger
l3 := g.Log("none")
// Corresponding to default configuration item logger
l4 := g.Log()
```

## Configuration Method (Advanced)

The configuration method is used for developers to perform configuration management themselves when using `glog` modularly.

List of methods:

Brief explanation:

1. You can set using `SetConfig` and `SetConfigWithMap`.
2. You can also use the `Set*` methods of the `Logger` object for specific configurations.
3. It should be noted that configuration items should be set before the `Logger` object executes log output to avoid concurrent safety issues.

We can use the `SetConfigWithMap` method to set/modify specific configurations of the `Logger` through `Key-Value` pairs, while other configurations use the default configuration. The name of the `Key` is the attribute name in the `Config` `struct`, and it is case-insensitive, supporting `-`/ `_`/ space symbols between words. For details, please refer to the conversion rules in the section [Type Conversion - Struct Conversion](../类型转换/类型转换-Struct转换.md).

Simple example:

```go
logger := glog.New()
logger.SetConfigWithMap(g.Map{
    "path":     "/var/log",
    "level":    "all",
    "stdout":   false,
    "StStatus": 0,
})
logger.Print("test")
```

Here `StStatus` indicates whether stack printing is enabled, set to `0` to disable. The key name can also be `stStatus`, `st-status`, `st_status`, `St Status`, and other configuration attributes are analogous.

## Precautions

Common issues: such as why the log component configuration does not take effect for logs printed by `HTTP Server`, `GRPC Server`, `ORM` components.

The `GoFrame` framework adopts a modular design, and the log component is an independent component of the framework. The configurations introduced in this chapter only take effect for independently using the log component, such as using `g.Log()` or `glog.New()`. The log configuration of other components has their own configuration items or log object setting methods to achieve log configuration. Please refer specifically to the corresponding component documentation and `API`.
