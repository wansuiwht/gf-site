## Introduction

The `GoFrame` framework offers powerful, rich, and unified error handling capabilities implemented through the `gerror` component. This component is also the unified error handling component of the framework. All components of the framework, if there is an error returned, are accompanied by stack information to facilitate developers in quickly identifying issues.

**Usage**:

```go
import "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/errors/gerror"
