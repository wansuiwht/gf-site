description: "Using the GoFrame framework for link tracking, focusing on demonstrating the method of transmitting Baggage data between services through an HTTP example. It provides a detailed explanation of client and server code implementation, including how to set and get Baggage, and offers a way to view link information through Jaeger, providing a practical guide for developers to achieve efficient link tracking in distributed systems."

## `baggage` Link Data Transmission

`baggage` transmits custom information between links (between services).

Example code address: [https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/example/trace/http](https://github.com/gogf/gf/tree/master/example/trace/http)

## Client

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/trace/otlphttp/v2"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/gtrace"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
)

const (
     serviceName = "otlp-http-client"
    endpoint    = "tracing-analysis-dc-hz.aliyuncs.com"
    path        = "adapt_******_******/api/otlp/traces"
)

func main() {
    var ctx = gctx.New()
    shutdown, err := otlphttp.Init(serviceName, endpoint, path)
   if err != nil {
        g.Log().Fatal(ctx, err)
    }
    defer shutdown()

    StartRequests()
}

func StartRequests() {
    ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(gctx.New(), "StartRequests")
    defer span.End()

    ctx = gtrace.SetBaggageValue(ctx, "name", "john")

    content := g.Client().GetContent(ctx, "http://127.0.0.1:8199/hello")
    g.Log().Print(ctx, content)
}
```

Brief explanation of client code:

1. First, the client also needs to initialize `Jaeger` through the `jaeger.Init` method.
2. Then, using `gtrace.SetBaggageValue(ctx, "name", "john")`, a `baggage` is set, which will be transmitted in all links of the request. However, in this example, there are only two nodes, so the `baggage` data will only be transmitted to the server. This method will return a new `context.Context` variable, which we will need to pass in the subsequent call chain.
3. Here, an HTTP client request object is created using `g.Client()`, which automatically enables link tracking features without requiring developers to explicitly call any methods or settings.
4. Finally, `g.Log().Print(ctx, content)` is used to print the server's return content, where `ctx` is used to pass link information to the logging component. If the `ctx` context object contains link information, the logging component will automatically include the `TraceId` in the log content.

## Server

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gogf/gf/contrib/trace/otlphttp/v2"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/frame/g"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/ghttp"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/net/gtrace"
    "github.com/gogf/gf/v2/os/gctx"
)

const (
     serviceName = "otlp-http-server"
    endpoint    = "tracing-analysis-dc-hz.aliyuncs.com"
    path        = "adapt_******_******/api/otlp/traces" )

func main() {
    var ctx = gctx.New()
    shutdown, err := otlphttp.Init(serviceName, endpoint, path)
    if err != nil {
        g.Log().Fatal(ctx, err)
    }
    defer shutdown()

    s := g.Server()
    s.Group("/", func(group *ghttp.RouterGroup) {
        group.GET("/hello", HelloHandler)
    })
    s.SetPort(8199)
    s.Run()
}

func HelloHandler(r *ghttp.Request) {
    ctx, span := gtrace.NewSpan(r.Context(), "HelloHandler")
    defer span.End()

    value := gtrace.GetBaggageVar(ctx, "name").String()

    r.Response.Write("hello:", value)
}
```

Brief explanation of server code:

1. Of course, the server also needs to initialize `Jaeger` through the `jaeger.Init` method.
2. The server starts with link tracking enabled, and developers do not need to call any methods or configure any settings explicitly.
3. The server uses `gtrace.GetBaggageVar(ctx, "name").String()` to obtain the `baggage` information submitted by the client and converts it to a string for return.

**Start the server:**

**Start the client:**

As you can see, the `baggage` submitted by the client has been successfully received and printed by the server. Also, the client outputs the `TraceId` information when logging. `TraceId` is a unique ID for a link, and it can be used to retrieve all log information for that link as well as query the detailed call chain on the `Jaeger` system.

View the link information on `Jaeger`:

As seen here, there are two service names: `tracing-http-client` and `tracing-http-server`, indicating that this request involves two services, specifically the HTTP request client and server, and each service involves `2` `span` link nodes.

When clicking on the details of this `trace`, you can see the hierarchical relationship of the call chain. Additionally, you can find the client's request address, the server's received route, and the server route function names. Let's introduce the `Attributes` and `Events` information of the client, or the `Tags` and `Process` information shown in `Jaeger`.

### HTTP Client Attributes

| `consumer` | Consumer, commonly used in MQ |

| `hostname` | Hostname of the current node |

| `http.connect.done` | Type and address after successful connection creation |

### HTTP Client Events

| Event/Log | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `http.request.headers` | `Header` information submitted by the HTTP client request, which may be large. |
| `http.request.baggage` | `Baggage` information submitted by the HTTP client request for inter-service link information transmission. |
| `http.request.body` | `Body` data submitted by the HTTP client request, which may be large. Only records up to `512KB`, exceeding which will be ignored. |
| `http.response.headers` | `Header` information returned by the HTTP client request, which may be large. |
| `http.response.body` | `Body` data returned by the HTTP client request, which may be large. Only records up to `512KB`, exceeding which will be ignored. |

### HTTP Server Attributes

![](/markdown/4df0d3d8e5de018788b9b134ea13d535.png)

The `Attributes` of the `HTTP Server` side are the same as those of the `HTTP Client`, and similar data is printed in the same request.

### HTTP Server Events

![](/markdown/f951072d1f5f116b90350788ad71bc89.png)

The `Events` of the `HTTP Server` side are the same as those of the `HTTP Client`, and similar data is printed in the same request.
